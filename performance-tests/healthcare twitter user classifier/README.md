# Healthcare Twitter user classifier evaluation

This test evaluates the [healthcare Twitter user classifier](https://github.com/JuanFF/healthcare-twitter-user-classifier) performance.

I have manually tested a sample of user profile descriptions tagged by the classifier.

The sample consists of 174 Twitter user descriptions that are publicly available.

The classifier returns one of the following tags for a given user profile: ```Academia```, ```Publishing source```, ```Doctor```, ```Professional```, ```Medical business```, ```Interested in healthcare```, ```News source```, ```Healthcare initiative```, ```Association```, ```Generic```.

The precision score is 0.86
